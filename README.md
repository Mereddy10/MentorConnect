# üìò MentorConnect

MentorConnect is a cross-platform app designed to simplify student-faculty collaboration.
It helps students discover faculty-led projects, apply with a statement of interest, and schedule meetings, all in one place.
We built this out of a real need we faced as students: the lack of a structured, transparent way to connect with mentors.
No more missed emails or unclear processes, just seamless mentorship.

Our goal: Make mentorship easy, efficient, and accessible.
